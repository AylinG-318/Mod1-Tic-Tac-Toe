Tic Tac Toe game requirements. 

An API call to our server. JavaScript Trivia first, 
Undertale trivia second, just in case. 

Ideas for the gameboard: 
Have 9 cards layed out, and if clicked and the resulting
question is correct, 
we toggle a class onto that card containing our X, or 
our O. 
(Have it flicker in. And play the undertale "accomplished" music, if you have time.)


Status: 
Coin Flip - Likely done.
